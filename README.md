### Target environment

(Google Play) 10,000 downloads

### Target active users

```
DAU = 10,000 * 0.3 * 0.5 = 1,500
```

- I looked up Download/MAU data, but came to the conclusion that it's "Case by Case"
    - assume 30% of Downloads as active users
- MAU/DAU is 20% for a normal program, but since we are a social network, I assume 50%
  (Facebook is about 68%, Discord is about 12%)

### Set up user information

#### Group

- Assume each user is in an average of five groups, two of which are active
- Assume each group has 1,500 chat messages
- Assume each group has an average of five members

#### Challenge

- Assume each user has 20 completed challenges in each group
- Assume each challenge has an average of 10 tasks
- Assume each user has two challenges in progress in each group
- Assume the current challenge has four failed tasks, four successful tasks, and two in-progress tasks
